# Linux Distributions (Distros)
## Linux Mint
A great distro for new linux users, this is based on Ubuntu's Long Term Support release but has additional tools to help guide new users and run smoothly without the need for detailed configurations. Ubuntu has the largest linux desktop community which leads to lots of online help and official support which is nearly always equally applicable to Mint. Valuing stability over new feature updates, this works well for someone who just wants their machine to work and doesn't care if they don't have the latest features of each and every program.

## Arch Linux
Almost the exact opposite philosophy from Mint, this distro is all about setting up a bleeding-edge system from the ground up for an individual's preferences. Rather than maintaining a long supported stable system of increasingly old programs, it is constantly updating, keeping pace with most new software releases directly from the developers. Arch Linux makes sharing software very easy by allowing anyone to contribute install scripts to the Arch User Repository. I have found this particularly useful for neuroimaging programs which are almost all under active development by other researchers and academics. Using Arch as my platform for my own analysis development allows me to keep up with important features from the neuroimaging in an integrated and automated way.

This website was written in markdown using neovim on Arch Linux and converted to html with pandoc.

# Terminal Applications
## Neovim
Vim is a decades old text editor program with an absolutely brilliant built in language for manipulating text. Neovim is a refactored and modernized version which is adding new features. Vim/neovim have many powerful extensions available letting you do everything from compiling LaTeX documents live as they are edited to automatically formatting Python code, you can see my particular configuration/plugins here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamtimms/configs/master/.config/nvim/init.Vim

## Pandoc
A very powerful little program for converting between document types. I use it often as it allows one to write quickly in the simple language of Markdown and then generate pdfs, slide shows, or websites (like this whole site!).

## Ranger
A fast terminal file browser which uses vim-style navigation. I use this rather than `cd` if I am navigating through multiple directories. Once in a directory of interest you can open a shell with `S` and continue working on the command line without interruption. Typing `exit` closes that shell and returns you to the ranger interface.

# Miscellaneous Scientific
## Zotero
I used to recommend Mendeley as a way to manage one's library of scientific literature but recent releases have become extremely buggy for large libraries and the company behind the program is increasingly hostile to users and have started trying to lock down one's library with encryption to limit user freedom to change platforms. Zotero is therefore a much better long term option.

## The Nipy Neuroimaging Python Suite

## Zathura
Not scientific software specifically but scientific papers are generally available in pdf format and this is a super fast and simple pdf reader which I use daily.
