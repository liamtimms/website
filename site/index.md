**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, UNFINISHED SITE**

This site is a simple overview of my life as a PhD student/researcher as well as a minor side project for me to play around with.

## Work:
### PhD
I currently work as a PhD student at Northeastern University in the Sridhar Lab. This work gives me the opportunity to take live MRI images of rat and human vasculature like this:

  <source srcset="/images/ratrender.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="/images/ratrender.jpg" alt="Render of Rat Neurovasculature">
</picture></p>
</a>

and to do many other interesting things with MRI imaging. More detail about my work can be found under the [**Research**](./pages/projects.html) section of this site.

## Life:
### Location
I live in an apartment in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of the city of Boston in the state of Massachusetts of the United States of America on the North American continent of the planet Earth circling the Sun in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy in the Local Group of the Virgo Supercluster of this reality. Hopefully, I won't leave most of these designations anytime soon.

### Hobbies
I enjoy reading, drawing and painting though I struggle to find time for each of them. I also enjoy working on basic programming and automation problems as I learn more about these tools (see my github). In non-COVID times, I try to maintain a robust social life while minimizing the use of social media. I also enjoy spending time with my wonderful girlfriend on the weekends, attending local concerts, visiting The Haven in JP and running table-top RPGs for other physics graduate students.
