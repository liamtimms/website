**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, UNFINISHED SITE**

This site is a simple overview of my life as a PhD student/researcher as well as a minor side project for me to play around with.

## Work
### PhD
I currently work as a PhD student at Northeastern University in the Sridhar Lab. This work gives me the opportunity to make images of rat and human vasculature like this:

  <source srcset="/images/ratrender.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="/images/ratrender.jpg" alt="Render of Rat Neurovasculature">
</picture></p>
</a>

and to do many other interesting things with MRI imaging. Lots more detail can be found under the **Research** section of this site.

## Personal Life
### Location
I live in an apartment in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of the city of Boston in the state of Massachusetts of the United States of America on the American continent of the planet Earth circling the Sun in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy in the Local Group of the Virgo Supercluster of this reality. I am unlikely to leave most of these groups in the near future.

### Hobbies
In my free time during the COVID epidemic, I have started painting again after many years. I also enjoy working on basic coding and automation problems as I learn more about these tools. In better times, I try to maintain a robust social life without using social media. I have a guitar which I continue to be extremely unskilled at playing. I enjoy spending time with my wonderful girlfriend on the weekends, going to small local concerts, visiting The Haven in JP and running table-top RPGs for other physics graduate students.
