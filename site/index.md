Welcome, to my personal website. Mostly, this site is a simple overview of my life as a PhD student/researcher as well as a minor side project for me to play around with. The site is a work-in-progress and is mostly a way for me to experiment with running my own web server.

## Work

### PhD

I currently work as a physics PhD student at **Northeastern University** in the [Sridhar Lab](https://srinivassridhar.com/). This work gives me the opportunity to take live MRI images of rat and human vasculature like this:

</a>

and to do many other interesting things with MRI imaging at the intersection of biology, neuroscience, computer science and, of course, physics. More detail about my work can be found under the [**Research**](./pages/projects.html) section of this site.

## Life

### Me

Here is my MRS ("Magnetic Resonance Selfie"):

This is a rendering of me I made in 3DSlicer using an anomtical MRI and FSL's brain extraction tool.

### Location

I live in an apartment in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of the city of Boston in the state of Massachusetts of the United States of America on the North American continent of the planet Earth circling the Sun in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way in the Local Group of the Virgo Supercluster of this reality. Ideally, I won't leave most of these designations anytime soon.

### Hobbies

I enjoy reading, drawing and painting though I struggle to find time for each of them. I also enjoy working on basic programming and automation problems as I learn more about these tools (see my github). In non-COVID times, I try to maintain a robust social life while minimizing the use of social media. I also enjoy spending time with my wonderful girlfriend on the weekends, attending local concerts, visiting The Haven in JP and running table-top RPGs for other physics graduate students.
