This site is a simple overview of my life as a researcher and a small personal side project. The site is a work-in-progress and functions as a way for me to experiment with running a web server from scratch without using a hosting service.

## Work

### PhD

In 2021, I finished my physics PhD at **Northeastern University** in the [Sridhar Lab](https://srinivassridhar.com/). I have coninued to work on related projects moving into 2022 but am now shifting my attention to new projects and directions. This work gave me the opportunity to take live MRI images of rat and human vasculature like this:

</a>

And to do many other novel things with MRI imaging at the intersection of biology, neuroscience, computer science, and physics. You can find more detail about my work (current and past) under the [**Research**](./pages/projects.html) section of this site.

## Life

### Me

Here is a "Magnetic Resonance Selfie":

</a>

I created this image of my head + brain by acquiring my anatomical MRI data with a colleague, processing it with a pipeline leveraging FSL (see useful software), and rendering it in 3DSlicer.

### Location

I live in an apartment in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of the city of Boston in the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, on the North American continent of the planet Earth, circling the Sun in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way in the Local Group of the Virgo Supercluster of this reality. Ideally, I won't leave the later designations any time soon though the former are considerably more flexible.

### Hobbies

While I wouldn't say I have much "spare time," I prioritize reading, drawing, and painting when not working on research. In addition, I enjoy working on basic programming and automation problems as I learn more about these tools. In non-COVID times, I often attended local concerts, visited my local pub with friends, and ran table-top RPGs for other physics graduate students.
